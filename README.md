# Car Management GUI for Database.
###### Martin Coleman, G00312351

## Introduction
This is my third year Final project. This is one part of the project. 
This is a GUI that interacts with the Database to Add, Update, Search, List and Delete Cars from the database.
The second part of the project is a website to display the information from the database.
The website will allow users to Search for cars by Make, Model or Registration.

##GUI
The GUI uses JDBC to connect the the mySQL database and uses SQL Commands to generate result sets from the database.
The Main Form contains Links to all the other forms that allow Adding, Searching, Updating and Listing.
